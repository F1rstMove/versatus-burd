# Burd - LASR
Burd is a decentralized microblogging platform built on the Versatus' [LASR (Language Agnostic Stateless Rollup)](https://versatus.io/blog/introducing-versatus-lasr-the-worlds-first-stateless-rolllup), allowing users to tweet, like,  and manage their digital identity cryptographically. This project leverages `@versatus/versatus-javascript` to interact with [LASR](https://versatus.io/blog/introducing-versatus-lasr-the-worlds-first-stateless-rollup), enabling secure and verifiable transactions for social interactions.
